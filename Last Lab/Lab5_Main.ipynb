    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook focuses on solving a 2x3 Slider Puzzle using classical search algorithms in Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n",
    "The problem is modeled as a state-space search problem where each move of a tile results in a new state. The puzzle is to be solved by a non-autonomous utility-based agent, which seeks the least-cost path from an initial to a goal configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see *uninformed search* algorithms like `breadth_first_search`, `depth_first_search` and `uniform_cost_search`, as well as *informed search* algorithms like `greedy_search` and `astar_search` in action. \n",
